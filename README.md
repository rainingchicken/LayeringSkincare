# LayeringSkincare
page to see if one can layer or not layer certain skincare products


Progress:
1. My first thought is to use scrab ingredients of skincare products from Amazon website since that is where I shop and read the ingredients, claims, and reviews. However, I am second guessing because there were some warnings that it may or may not be illegal and that you might be banned from using Amazon. So I am using Skincare Products Clean Dataset by Erin Ward at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eward96/skincare-products-clean-dataset which is a safer and faster. However, it will not include all skincare products...

2. I am going to use python to do data analysis to extract key ingredients such as vitamin C, Retinol, Niacinamide, etc.

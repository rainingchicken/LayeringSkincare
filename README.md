# LayeringSkincare
page to see if one can layer or not layer certain skincare products


Progress:
1. My first thought is to use scrab ingredients of skincare products from Amazon website since that is where I shop and read the ingredients, claims, and reviews. However, I am second guessing because there were some warnings that it may or may not be illegal and that you might be banned from using Amazon. So I am using Skincare Products Clean Dataset by Erin Ward at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eward96/skincare-products-clean-dataset which is a safer and faster. However, it will not include all skincare products...

2. I am going to use python to do data analysis to extract key ingredients such as vitamin C, Retinol, Niacinamide, etc.

3. I cannot figure an easy way to get variables from python to js so I tried looking at sql in node.js but that looks scary that I have to log in and out of database. So instead of trying to get and use python or SQL, just have js read csv file directly. Maybe it will be easier to use python to clean csv and store it in another csv file?
